    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried chicken is a crispy, golden dish made by coating chicken pieces in seasoned batter and deep-frying them until tender and juicy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>30 saltine crackers</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dry potato flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place crackers in a large resealable plastic bag; seal bag and crush crackers with a rolling pin until they are coarse crumbs. Add the flour, potato flakes, seasoned salt, and pepper and mix well.
